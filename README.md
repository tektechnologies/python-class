# Notes from CCR learning

- recording
- breaks
- terminal environment
- editor environment
- introductions for instructors longer than students
- students - Name, job, geeky fact
- demo practice 15 - 20 after lunch
- when is lunch hour
- how to search for answers at W3c schools and how to apply examples
- are we in there slack channel or what does the company use to communicate, "teams"?

## day two

- tshirt for those who did the homework.

Writing a script - Humans can easily accomplish complex goals and tasks without thinking about them to much. Computers don't learn how to do tasks, they follow rules explicitly. So we start with a big picture to help develop the rules, list of steps, to create a runnable executable code.

1. Define the Goal - Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
2. Design the Script - Write out the directions
3. Code each step. - Try to Make the sandwich according to Directions -> Eat the Sandwich?

First, make it work, then make it right, then make it fast.

- review over
- add white board diagram for what file accessing we are going to do.
- visual before reading writing or appending using while loops. graphic should explain why we would do this as well.
- list out comments as steps to what and why we are creating the next concept ~ modules
- in the refactor comment the order of operations before you refactor then seeing the place of the comments reflected in the refactor of our main functions to our modules.

### After lunch

- Maybe code along for the afternoon.. giving everyone the curage to try to code and see it work.
- classes are easy to code but hard to understand - build up their confidence.. Now that we have dumped() on them
- virtual env install is heavy, make sure TA knows how to do this, I was not helpful in any way ðŸ«¢
