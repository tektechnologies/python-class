Writing a script - Humans can easily accomplish complex goals and tasks without thinking about them to much. Computers don't learn how to do tasks, they follow rules explicitly. So we start with a big picture to help develop the rules, list of steps, to create a runnable executable code.

1. Define the Goal - Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
2. Design the Script - Write out the directions
3. Code each step. - Try to Make the sandwich according to Directions -> Eat the Sandwich?

First, make it work, then make it right, then make it fast.
